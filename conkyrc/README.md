# config-files

### Installation

My zsh theme is based on [agnoster](https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme), to run it smoothly just install the dependencies.

```sh
$ git https://github.com/snackk/config-files
$ ./install.sh && echo "Enjoy :)"
```
Any problem with install just run:
```sh
$ chmod +x install.sh
```
