# Arch configuration files

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/snackk/arch-config-files.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/snackk/arch-config-files)

## Overview

This is a set of configs that I personally have in every linux computer. To help solve the logistics of installing this into a fresh system, there's a simple shell script that handles that.

## Installation

```sh
$ mkdir ~/git && cd ~/git 
$ git https://github.com/snackk/arch-config-files
$ ./install.sh
```

Any problem with install just run:
```sh
$ chmod +x install.sh
```
