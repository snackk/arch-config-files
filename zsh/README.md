# zsh

## Overview

My personal configs for zsh shell.

## Installation

To install ONLY this config file:
```sh
$ git https://github.com/snackk/arch-config-files
$ cd zsh
$ ./install.sh && echo "Enjoy :)"
```

Any problem with install just run:
```sh
$ chmod +x install.sh
```

### Snackster Theme

My zsh theme is based on [agnoster](https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme). You'll need to install a few things in order to run it properly, you can find these dependencies on the *agnoster*.
